# PIC Skeleton Codes:  OpenMP/Vectorization (now with OpenACC)

These codes illustrate how to use hybrid shared memory/vectorization algorithm, with a tiled scheme on each shared memory multi-core node implemented wit OpenMP and vectorization implemented with both SSE vector intrinsics and compiler vectorization. The tiling scheme is described in detail in Ref.[4]. The Intel SSE2 vector intrinsics are a low level data parallel language closely related to the native assembly instructions. The compiler vectorization uses compiler directives and often requires reorganization of the data structures and loops.

(FST)  After speaking with VKD we have decided to re-visit the OpenACC language and we want to see if it is able to produce efficient code for the GPU.  Because this code is optimized for Intel vector processors it should be easy for the PGI/Cray compiler with OpenACC support to digest and produce reasonable, if not efficient codes.


For the 2D electrostatic with 12 processing cores:
  * no-vec = 2.7 nsec/particle/timestep
  * compiler vec = 2.0 nsec/particle/timestep
  * SSE2 = 1.6 nsec/particle/timestep

For the 2-1/2D electromagnetic with 12 processing cores:
  * no-vec = 9.2 nsec/particle/timestep
  * compiler vec = 6.1 nsec/particle/timestep
  * SSE2 = 4.2 nsec/particle/timestep

With SSE2 intrinsics one typically obtains about 2x speedup compared to no vectorization. Compiler vectorization achieves about 1.5x speedup.

For the 3D code, the SSE2 vector intrinsics have not been implemented.
